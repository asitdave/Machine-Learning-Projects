# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my machine learning projects repository! This portfolio contains a series of hands-on projects designed to demonstrate various machine learning techniques, algorithms, and workflows. Each project explores different aspects of data science, from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.


## Recent Project

[Aircraft Defect Detection and Automated Image Captioning](./Aircraft-Defect-Detection-and-Automated-Image-Captioning/)

**Objective**:
- Use the VGG16 pretrained model for image classification.
- Prepare and preprocess image data.
- Evaluate the model's performance and visualize predictions on test data.
- Use BLIP pretrained model for image captioning and summarization.
- Generate caption and summary for an aircraft image.

<!-- **Techniques Used**:
- User Segmentation: Clustering with K-Means to categorize user behaviors.
-  -->

## Future Projects

This repository will continue to grow as I add more machine learning projects. Here are the general areas that will be covered:

-   **Supervised Learning**: Classification and Regression problems
-	**Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
-	**Deep Learning**: Neural Networks and Computer Vision

## List of Projects

| Sr. No. | Project Name    | Category    | Short Description        |
|:-------:|:----------------|:-----------:|:-------------------------|
| 1       | [Housing Price Prediction](./Housing%20Price%20Prediction/)   | Regression   | Developed a regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as amenities, area, and location. |
| 2       | [FMNIST Image Classification](./FMNIST-Image-classification/)    | Classification      | Implemented a neural network to classify Fashion-MNIST images into categories like shirts, shoes, and bags.   |
| 3       | [Transaction Anomaly Detection](./Transaction-Anomaly-Detection/)   | Classification  | Detected anomalies in financial transactions using Isolation Forest.      |
| 4       | [User Segmentation and App Uninstall Prediction](./App-Users-Segmentation/)   | Clustering     | Analyzed user behaviour to segment users and predict app uninstallation using K-means, Random Forest, and XGBoost.   |
| 5       | [Aircraft Defect Detection and Automated Image Captioning](./Aircraft-Defect-Detection-and-Automated-Image-Captioning/)     | Classification & Computer Vision   |  Developed a deep learning pipeline for aircraft defect detection via image classification and automated image captioning/summarization using pretrained models. |
